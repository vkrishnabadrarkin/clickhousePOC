1. type tag is enum .. add multiple values ? how?
2. Geo loation not yet added
3. metric data not yet attached .. How to edit/ add more values in the array of nested columns check?
4. can we able to add column to nested data structure ?(if ip.name,ip.modelkey exist and want to add another ip.type is it possible )
    (tried adding a column but added as a new column with name ip.type ..need to check

5. metric data (as of now) adding all at once with diff time stamps ? (i.e while data is being generated)



realisations :

nested data structures cannot be updated,

nested is used to avoid repeated code writing , instead we can just store them with pre defined indexing
